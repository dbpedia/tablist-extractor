# Writing mapping rules is simple --> you have to fill all empty fields remembering this structure:
# 'table's header / list's section':'ontology property' (Example:  'year':'Year', 'GP':'gamesPlayed','High school name':'nameSchool'). 

# Elements which are already depicts that they have already been found in the common dictionary
# or on dbpedia ontology.
# If you empty a field that was filled, you will delete that rule from dictionary.
